<H1>ConjuFrench</H1>
<p>ConjuFrench is the result of my final project in the IOS course for the fall semester of 2023. In this application, you will be able to see the functionalities of login, sign in, and log out. Upon successfully logging into the app, you can choose from a variety of French verbs to view their conjugations in French. All of this with the assistance of an API developed in Python..</p>
